# This controls the number of previous user password iterations to keep in
# history, in order to enforce that newly created passwords are unique. Setting
# the value to one (the default) disables this feature. Thus, to enable this
# feature, values must be greater than 1. This feature depends on the `sql`
# backend for the `[identity] driver`. (integer value)
# Minimum value: 1

# The regular expression used to validate password strength requirements. By
# default, the regular expression will match any password. The following is an
# example of a pattern which requires at least 1 letter, 1 digit, and have a
# minimum length of 7 characters: ^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{7,}$ This feature
# depends on the `sql` backend for the `[identity] driver`. (string value)

# Describe your password regular expression here in language for humans. If a
# password fails to match the regular expression, the contents of this
# configuration variable will be returned to users to explain why their
# requested password was insufficient. (string value)
