Subject: [PATCH] rabbit: increase heartbeat rate to decrease poll interval

The poll_timeout is tied to the heartbeat_rate value when the
heartbeat_timeout_threshold is non-zero.  It works out to be:

   threshold / rate / 2

Therefore the default is 60 / 2 / 2 = 15.  This causes the recv() to block for
up to 15 seconds unless there are incoming RPC messages.  This is problematic
for graceful shutdown of services as the stop() request may block if the recv()
is blocked.  To ensure that the recv() does not block for a long time we are
reducing the interval by controlling the rate.
