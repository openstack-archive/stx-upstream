DESCRIPTION
===========
This SDK Module provides example HEAT templates to assist Titanium Cloud
users in writing their own HEAT templates.  Simple examples of the 
more commonly used HEAT resources can be found in heat/simple/ directory, 
in a YAML file named after the heat resource.  More complex examples of 
heat templates, involving several different inter-related heat resources 
can be found in heat/scenarios/ directory.

NOTE that the contents of this SDK Module can also be found on the 
controllers, at /etc/heat/templates/ .


BACKGROUND
==========
HEAT is an Orchestration service that is meant to simplify the launching and 
basic management of complex applications or application 'Services' (or using 
Heat terminology, a 'Stack'). An application Service consists of a set of related 
resources (VMs, Flavors, Images, Volumes, Networks, Subnets, Routers, Load 
Balancers, Firewalls, Scaling Policies, etc.) that collectively provide a higher 
order Application Function (e.g. Evolved Packet Core, Class 5 Call Server, Signaling 
and Media Session Border Controller, etc.). Nearly all of the individual OpenStack 
commands that are executed to create the individual resources of an application service 
can be described in a HEAT template. HEAT also provides a means of auto-scaling the 
application service. VMs or other resource types can be scaled horizontally or 
vertically based on measurements of cloud-platform-monitored metrics or 
guest-application-monitored metrics. In regard to VM for example, scaling 
horizontally (in/out) means decreasing/increasing number of VMs, whereas scaling 
vertically (up/down) means resizing the VM by increasing or decreasing its resources 
(e.g. vcpus).

Titanium Cloud utilizes HEAT templates to enable customers to easily launch and 
manage application Services. A set of Titanium Cloud templates are provided that can 
be used as a reference to create application Service templates.


DELIVERABLE
===========
The Heat Template SDK Module is delivered as source YAML files in a compressed 
tarball called "wrs-heat-templates-#.#.#.tgz".  


Simple examples of the more commonly used HEAT resources can be found in 
the hot/simple/ directory, in a YAML file named after the heat resource.

                                          the external network's subnet and a default IP Route 
                                          is created using the gateway_ip of the subnet.

                                          VM Instances with group attributes such as 
                                          compute-node affinity or anti-affinity.

                                          inside of OS::Nova::Server to assign a VM Instance 
                                          to a ServerGroup.
    WR_Neutron_ProviderNet.yaml         - Creates a Provider Network specifying the name and 
                                          type (i.e. flat, vlan or vxlan).
    WR_Neutron_ProviderNetRange.yaml    - Creates a segment id range for a Provider Network;

                                          of the segment id range.



More complex examples of heat templates, involving several different inter-related 
heat resources can be found in hot/scenarios/ directory.

./hot/scenarios:
    BootFromCinder.yaml                 - A small single VM Instance scenario; intended to 
                                          illustrate the creation of a Cinder Volume and then 
                                          the launching / creation of a VM Instance using this 
                                          Cinder Volume as its boot device.
    CombinationAutoScaling.yaml         - A single template that creates a simple VM In/Out 
                                          auto-scaling use case. A single Load Balancer VM is 
                                          created and an AutoScalingGroup of server VMs is 
                                          created which scales in or out based on link 
                                          utilization. 
    NestedAutoScale.yaml                - A more complex In/Out autoscaling use case that 
                                          scales a Stack In/Out.  A single Load Balancer VM is
                                          created and an AutoScalingGroup of a Heat Stack
                                          (containing a Cinder Volume and a VM) is created 
                                          which scales in or out based on link utilization.
    NestedStack.yaml                    - The Heat Stack being scaled In/Out in the above 
                                          use case.  A Stack containing a Cinder Volume and
                                          a VM.
    Networking_and_Servers.yaml         - Two different examples of creating VMs attached 
                                          to a Tenant Network containing two Subnets;
                                          illustrating how to specify the exact subnet to 
                                          attach to, if required.
    PortForwarding.yaml                 - An example of 3 VMs/Servers sharing 1 External IP
                                          address, using a unique External Port to forward 
                                          traffic to the correct VM/Server.
    VMAutoScaling.yaml                  - A template that creates a typical resource 
                                          Up/Down auto-scaling use case.  The size of a VM in 
                                          terms of number of guest vcpus is scaled up or down 
                                          based on average cpu utilization.
    LabSetup.yaml                       - A complex example of setting up a large virtual
                                          LAB with a number of resources and resource types.
                                          The Stack contains/creates 2 provider networks,
                                          a keypair, 2 flavors, 4 networks, 5 subnets and
                                          2 routers with gateways setup.

USAGE
=====
The HEAT template (YAML) files can be used to create a 'Stack' by using either the 
HEAT CLI, Heat Rest APIs and/or the Heat Horizon panel (Orchestration).

For example, to create a 'Stack' using the HEAT CLI:
    heat stack-create -f <heat-template-yaml-filename> <stack-name>

Refer to the Titanium Cloud Administration Guide, Managing Stacks Section, for 
additional information on using HEAT:
    * Overview of YAML Template format,
    * Description on how to pass 'parameters' to a HEAT stack,
    * Description of TiS-specific Extensions to HEAT,
    * Examples of how to launch a HEAT Stack using the CLI and Horizon,
    * How to pass User Data to a VM/Server/Guest in a HEAT template,
    * Overview of HEAT Autoscaling; both In/Out and Up/Down,
    * Examples of using heat-cfntools in Guest to report Guest Metrics
      to Ceilometer and optionally use for HEAT Autoscaling,
    * and more.


CAVEATS
=======

TiS-specific Extensions to HEAT are only provided for the Heat Orchestration Template 
(HOT) format; NOT for the CloudFormatioN (CFN) format.  HEAT in Titanium Cloud will still accept
and work with CFN-formatted heat templates; this CFN format is just simply not 
extended with additional Titanium Cloud HEAT capabilities.

Example CFN-formatted HEAT templates are no longer provided in this SDK Module.  Example 
CFN-formatted HEAT template files can be found at 
    https://github.com/openstack/heat-templates/tree/master/cfn
